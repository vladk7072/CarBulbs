                  Headlights have become quite the statement piece for new vehicles, as the shapes, luminosity, and
                  designs have become more and more futuristic over the years. And they‘re as functional as they are fun
                  to look at.

                  the easiest vehicle maintenance procedures anyone can pull off.

              The first aspect of your automotive bulb to decide on is whether you want to go with halogen, LED or Xenon
              bulbs. Here are a few benefits to help you choose the best for your car and your lifestyle:
            </p>
            <p class="clean__text">
              Halogen light bulbs have a long lifetime and are usually priced well making replacement costs low. They
              produce a standard amount of light and are a warmer color than LEDs. Halogens also come in several sizes
              for several models making them more versatile than other lights.
            </p>
            <p class="clean__text">
              LEDs are a good option for many people because the lights are considered to be more energy efficient. They
              produce a brighter light than other lights. LEDs are also installable in many applications that work to
              produce a concentrated light beam. Most of them are easier to install than halogens because they come with
              a plug and play feature and they are less prone to get damaged during installation.
            </p>
            <p class="clean__text">
              Xenon lights, which are also known as high-intensity discharge (HID) lights, can produce a brighter light
              and with less heat than halogen bulbs. They emit a blue-white light that is extremely bright and is
              excellent for visibility at night or during bad weather. They are also cost efficient because while they
              require a large amount of power when they first turn on they require much less energy to maintain the
              brightness.
            </p>
            <p class="clean__text">
              After choosing LED, halogen or Xenon all that's left is to find out what kind of light bulb is needed for
              your car, truck, SUV, etc. The easiest way is to match the ANSI code from the old bulb with the new bulb.
              The ANSI code can typically be found on the base of the bulb and is a row of numbers and letters. If you
              are uncertain of what the ANSI code is our bulb finder can assist you with your selection.

                  A. Most people, regardless of skill level, will be able to ﬁnd the headlights and replace them without
                  issue. Certain vehicle manufacturers have made reaching the headlights difﬁcult by placing tons of
                  vehicle components in front of them, but it should be relatively easy to change a bulb.
